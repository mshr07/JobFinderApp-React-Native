## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React Native** - Mobile app framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better development experience
- **Redux Toolkit** - State management
- **React Navigation v6** - Navigation library
- **React Native Reanimated** - Advanced animations
- **AsyncStorage** - Local data storage
- **Axios** - HTTP client
- **React Hook Form** - Form handling
- **Expo** - Development and deployment platform

## 📱 React Native Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Core Components
- `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `ScrollView`
- `FlatList` for efficient list rendering
- `TextInput` for user input
- `TouchableOpacity` for interactions
- `StatusBar` for system UI

### 2. Hooks Used
- `useState` - Local component state
- `useEffect` - Side effects and lifecycle
- `useCallback` - Function memoization
- `useMemo` - Value memoization
- Custom hooks for business logic

### 3. Navigation Patterns
- **Stack Navigation**: Login → Home → Job Details
- **Tab Navigation**: Bottom tabs for main sections
- **Nested Navigation**: Tabs within stack
- **Conditional Navigation**: Based on auth state

### 4. State Management Patterns
- **Global State**: User auth, job listings
- **Local State**: Form inputs, UI state
- **Async State**: API loading states
- **Persistent State**: AsyncStorage integration

### 5. Performance Techniques
- FlatList optimization with `keyExtractor`
- Image caching and optimization
- Component memoization with `React.memo`
- Debounced search to reduce API calls
- Virtualization for large lists

### 6. Styling Approaches
- StyleSheet for component styling
- Responsive design with Dimensions API
- Theme system with constants
- Platform-specific styling
- Accessibility considerations

## 🚦 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or later)
- React Native development environment
- Expo CLI (optional but recommended)
